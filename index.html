					Living systems are characterized by the recurrent <strong>emergence of patterns</strong>: power-laws
					distributions, long-range correlations and structured self-organization in living matter are
					the norm, rather than the exception. All these features are also typical of systems poised near a <strong>critical point</strong>.
					The great lesson from Physics is that criticality can emerge as a collective behaviour in a many-body system with simple
					interactions and its characteristics depend only on few details, like the dimensionality or the symmetries.
					<br><br>
					One of the most striking feature of living systems is that they are structured as evolving systems were
					interactions can turn-on or off, as well as strengthening and weakening,
					reconfiguring the system connectivity. Thus, by rearranging both the structural and
					functional topology, living interacting systems may demonstrate unique <strong>evolvability,
					scalability and adaptability</strong> properties.
					<br><br>
					Among these systems, the brain is probably one of the most impressively complex and
					has received a considerable amount of attention in recent years, aided by the vast amount
					of experimental data available. The idea that the <strong>collective behavior of neurons</strong> might
					emerge from a self-organized critical state has been widely studied, from its fundamental
					mechanisms to its functional advantages, and it poses a fascinating question that is far
					from being answered.
					<br><br>
					It is of crucial importance to make further steps in the understanding of the main properties
					that simultaneously confer to these systems <strong>high level of adaptability, robustness and
					optimality</strong>. If we can “learn” from evolution and unravel the basic principles then we would
					be able to both better manage/supervise these systems and also design more optimal and
					sustainable new systems.
